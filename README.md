For my concluding web development project, I'm utilizing the MEN stack to implement CRUD functionalities, incorporating HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PassportJS. The project is centered around emulating a dynamic website similar to Yelp, focusing on the registration, management, and creation of campgrounds. Additionally, the platform enables users to explore and discover campgrounds in different locations.
